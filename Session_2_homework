/*
Description: Write a class called FC.java that converts a temperature from Farhenheit to Centigrade.

Result: the answer is printed in the form: <F temp> = <C temp>.

Tips: use the template we saw in class to solve the plane cost program. You need
 a class called FC that encloses a single method called main to do the work.
